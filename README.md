A React web app that generates a list of the songs you have in common with other Spotify users based on public playlist info.

Web app available at: https://music-matcher-project.web.app/

This app uses the Spotify API to pull a list of the inputted users' playlists, send additional requests for the songs on each playlist, and identify the songs in common using methods from the <a href="https://lodash.com/">lodash</a> open-source library. Styling was developed using <a href="https://styled-components.com/">styled-components</a>.

If you do not have a Spotify account, you can use the following usernames for the demo: spotify:user:chrissy.walley, spotify:user:1229503923.
